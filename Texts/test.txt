Next up on news at 11: “HBO No Show”. Have people discovered that HBOGo is more than just for Game of Thrones? Has George R. R. Martin perished in the “Blazin’ Wing Challenge” at Buffalo Wild Wings? Do people still eat at Buffalo Wild Wings? Will Tyrion Lannister ever get taller? This and more, at 11.

Dada da. dada. da. da da. da.

Patricia - Hello, everyone, I’m Patricia Flume.

Steven - And I’m Steven Bridgewater.
 
Patricia - Breaking news tonight, ladies and gentlemen, this just in: user celticsfan74 has canceled his subscription to HBOGO, leaving millions without access to the popular television subscription service. Let's go now to our reporter in the field: Bob Lancaster . Bob, what do you have to tell us?

Scene pans to a prerecorded (shh, the audience members don’t have to know) video spot of Bob Lancaster outside, in the field. Maybe a field. Just outside. For sure, outside.

Bob - Well, Pat, it’s really looking grim. As you can see behind me, the city is in a state of chaos. Show scenes from Ukrainian riots or something. As most of the moochers of celticsfan74 have forgotten how to download torrents of Game of Thrones safely and inconspicuously, many have had their identities stolen and have lost anywhere from thousands of dollars to their entire life savings. There is rioting on the street as police break into homes to arrest the illegal torrenters. It's really not looking good here, Patricia. 

Steven - My goodness, that indeed does not look good. slightly chuckles to himself

Patricia - Thanks for the input, Steven.

Steven - I do my best, winks at camera

Patricia - We also have with us here tonight our senior analyst, Jonathan Garcia. Jon, give us the scoop.

Jon - We have been tirelessly at work, Patty, and it appears that the 74 at the end of the username might signify a birthdate, making the subscriber 50. 

Steven - Jon could you tell some of our less receptive viewers just quite indeed what that very well may possibly mean?

Jon - Would you like to do the pleasure, Steve?

Steve - Please, Jon, it’s your job.

Jon - I’d really like you to explain this apparently obvious fact, Steve. I’m actually sure you don’t know it.

Steve - smiles and looks straight into the camera

Patricia - Oh, Jon would you just tell us?

Jon - Right. Well makes absolute sense that the user is over 30, as younger generations have long forgotten what it means to pay for entertainment. With The Sopranos and Sex in the City Long gone, it is likely that the older subscriber tried his luck with the hit HBO fantasy/dungeon-porn/adventure series, and found the material a bit overwhelming.

Steven - You took the words right out of my mouth, Jon. I swear they were there. 

quickly followed by patricia, dismissing Steve
Patricia - Wasn’t there some sort of emergency plan in place should such a blackout occur?

Bob - Hi, Bob Lancaster here. I know you often forget about me in the field, but I am still out here … in the field.

Patricia - Uh … Bob, do you have any pertinent knowledge on any emergency plans that have been implemented?

Bob - As a matter of fact, Trish, I do. First responders have been handing out iPads preloaded with reruns of Breaking Bad and Sons of Anarchy, which is not even HBO content.

Patricia clutching her ear
Patricia - Actually I’m hearing reports right now of HBO public representatives distributing Itunes free singles of the week and printouts of the top 100 texts from project gutenberg.

Meanwhile, Steven clutches his ears and tries to hear something, but nothing is coming to him. He seems frustrated.

Jon whips out his phone, glances at it, and looks at the camera
Jon - Due to aesthetic difficulties, our rather unpleasant-looking second reporter cannot be shown tonight. However, he has just confirmed the free handouts. Also, what’s that? It appears as though the more jaded second responders are handing out pads of paper and pens, saying “Entertainment! Here’s your entertainment. In my day, we didn’t even have electrons.”

Steve - Well, there you have it folks.

Patricia - Have? Steven, what do we have? We have nothing. All we know is that HBO handing out free forms of entertainment left and right, which offers no permanent solution to the millions of refugees afflicted by the HBO blackout

Bob - Indeed. It seems that HBO is not in possession of any of its material.

Jon - But, if HBO doesn’t have … Bob, are you saying…. pauses, aghast at the revelation

Steven perks up as if to answer. 

Patricia dismissively waves at him as if to say, ‘no, Steve, it’s not your turn’

Jon, after looking at Steven and his quietus, resumes:

Jon - are you saying that …

Bob - That’s exactly right, Jon.

Patricia - I don’t underst-

The janitor sweeping around the stage the whole time bursts out in geriatric clarity 
Janitor - Don’t you see! No one has H-BOGO. Even HBO was stealing from celticsfan74’s subscription. It’s all derivative! Our roots have been cut, the trunk isolated!

Everyone stands in disbelief of Janitor
Steven - Wow, he should have my job.

Patricia - quickly He really should have your job. back to janitor Now, what were you saying? HBO was stealing its own subscription service from itself?

Janitor - Precisely! From the one true font of authenticity and earnestness, the Baby Boomers. Its the generation from which all forms of paid entertainment thrives. After their 40’s and 50’s, they grew tired of being disillusioned by the world, and, now with their bones shrinking, and their minds mellowing, they are content to slowly drip their life savings away on matinees, overpriced toys for their grandchildren, and television subscription services

After craning his head back and looking at his phone the whole time with a frowning squint, not even listening, Steve pipes in
Steve - My word! Have you all seen the Vice tweet? They asked the CEO of HBO this entire affair!

Patricia - Well?

Steven - He Declined to comment. does a little pose and gives a satisfied look and nods at camera

Jon – Wait, I’m hearing reports that George R. R. Martin was just spotted in a Sizzler’s with this to say, “Fuck you all for stealing my shit. Also, I am not dead yet, nor do I plan to die in the near future. Stop bothering me….” 


As he says cut, everyone relaxes, and some of Asinine (As stage crew) go onstage and start helping out with stuff

Director - Aand cut.  Great work everyone, super meta, super topical, National Geographic is going to love it. Love. It. The World Without HBO, we’ll call it. This is day one of the documentary

Assistant Director - I think it dragged a bit at the end, don’t you, boss?

Director - Yes, yes, well, ending scenes cleanly is difficult even for the best of writers. Even Shakespeare ended up killing everyone off. We all know how Lost and Dexter ended: poorly. The ends are bound to disappoint, let’s just focus on the middle, and everyone will be happy at least for the majority.

Assistant Director - What if we just cut out mid sentence, you know, to mirror the subscription getting shut down.

Director - Yes! I love the symbolism, let’s roll it one more time! 

Assistant Director - But the ending mid sentence? Are we still -
